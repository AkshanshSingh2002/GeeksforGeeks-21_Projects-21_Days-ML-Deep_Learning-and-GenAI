# 21 Projects in 21 Days – Machine Learning, Deep Learning & GenAI

## 🧠 Overview

Welcome to the **21 Projects in 21 Days** challenge! This repository documents a comprehensive learning journey through Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Generative AI. Each day features a hands-on project designed to build practical skills, from foundational data analysis to advanced neural networks and AI applications.

**Learning Goals:**
- Master data exploration, visualization, and storytelling
- Implement ML algorithms (classification, regression, clustering)
- Build deep learning models (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers)
- Explore generative AI and prompt engineering
- Develop end-to-end solutions for real-world problems
